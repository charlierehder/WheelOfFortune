Terminal based implementation of the game, Wheel of Fortune. The game consists of 3 rounds, the first two played with all three players and the last one played only by the player with the highest bank balance of the first two rounds. The first player to guess the word in any given round gets to keep their bank balance for that round, the others players lose their balance. If the last word is guessed correctly a special prize is won. 

Implemented with Python 3.6.9
