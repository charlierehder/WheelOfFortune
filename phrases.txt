a blessing in disguise
a dime a dozen
beat around the bush
better late than never
bite the bullet
break a leg
call it a day
cut somebody some slack
cutting corners
easy does it
get out of hand
get something out of your system
give someone the benefit of the doubt
go back to the drawing board
hang in there
hit the sack
it's not rocket science
let someone off the hook
make a long story short
miss the boat
no pain no gain
on the ball
pull someone's leg
pull youself together
so far so good
speak of the devil
that's the last straw
the best of both worlds
time flies when you're having fun
to get bent out of shape
to make matters worse
under the weather
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
wrap your head around something
you can say that again
your guess is as good as mine
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a penny for your thoughts
a penny saved is a penny earned
a perfect storm
a picture is worth a thousand words
actions speak louder than words
add insult to injury
barking up the wrong tree
birds of a feather flock together
bite off more than you can chew
break the ice
by the skin of your teeth
comparing apples to oranges
costs an arm and a leg
do something at the drop of a hat
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
don't count your chickens before they hatch
don't cry over spilt milk
don't give up your day job
don't put all your eggs in one basket
every cloud has a sliver lining
get a taste of your own medicine
give someone the cold shoulder
go on a wild goose chase
good things come to those who wait
he has bigger fish to fry
hit the nail on the head
ignorance is bliss
it ain't over till the fat lady sings
it takes one to know one
it's a piece of cake
it's raining cats and dogs
kill two birds with one stone
let the cat out of the bag
live and learn
look before you leap
on thin ice
once in a blue moon
play devil's advocate
put something on ice
rain on someone's parade
saving for a rainy day
slow and steady wins the race
spill the beans
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
the ball is in your court
the best thing since sliced bread
the devil is in the details
the early bird gets the worm
the elephant in the room
the whole nine yards
there are other fish in the sea
there's a method to his madness
there's no such thing as a free lunch
throw caution to the wind
you can't have your cake and eat it too
you can't judge a book by its cover
